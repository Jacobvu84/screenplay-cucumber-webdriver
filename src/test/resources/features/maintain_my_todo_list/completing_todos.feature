Feature: Completing todos
  
  In order to make me feel **a sense of accomplishment**
  As a forgetful person
  I want to be to _view all of things I have completed_

  @jacob11
  Scenario: Mark a task as completed in Cucumber
    Given that Jane has a todo list containing Buy some milk, Walk the dog
    When she completes the task called 'Walk the dog'
    And she filters her list to show only Completed tasks
    Then her todo list should contain Walk the dog

  @jacob12
  Scenario: List of completed items should be empty if nothing has been completed
    Given that Jane has a todo list containing Buy some milk, Walk the dog
    When she filters her list to show only Completed tasks
    Then her todo list should be empty
